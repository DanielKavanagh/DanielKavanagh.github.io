As a Cloud Support Associate (in the Deployment team) I was responsible for supporting customer's with a large variety of AWS services, including:

- [Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html)
- [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html)
- [Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html)
- [OpsWorks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [CodeDeploy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [CodePipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [CodeStar](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/welcome.html)
- [AWS Cloud9](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/welcome.html)
- [AWS Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/what-is-batch.html)
- [AWS GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-intro.html)

To provide the best experience for our customer's, I developed an in-depth understanding of how these services function. This process included learning the best practices for each of these services, and the different use-cases for each of them. 

Many of the services listed above also require a knowledge of other technologies. For instance, ECS is used to deploy and manage Docker containers, so in this role I also became familar with the inner-workings of Docker as a technology as well as how to create and manage Docker images. 

I've included a list of these non AWS technologies below:

- Docker
- Chef
- Jenkins
- JSON/YAML
